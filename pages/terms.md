## Terms and Conditions

Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms") carefully before using our applications (the "Service") operated by Blue Comet Labs LLC ("Blue Comet Labs", "us", "we", or "our").

Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all users who access or use the Service. Acceptance is deemed to occur when you download, install, create an account, or otherwise use the Service.

By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the Terms, you may not access the Service.

### Subscriptions

Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing Cycles are set either on a monthly or yearly basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.

At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal through ["Subscriptions" in the Settings app](https://apps.apple.com/account/subscriptions).

### Free Trial

Blue Comet Labs may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time ("Free Trial").

On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you canceled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.

### Fee Changes

Blue Comet Labs, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.

### Refunds

Except when required by applicable law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable. Refund requests required under local consumer protection laws will be processed in accordance with such laws.

### Limitation of Liability

In no event shall Blue Comet Labs, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from:

1. Your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service.
2. Any conduct or content of any third party on the Service.
3. Any content obtained from the Service.
4. Unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or content.

Whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), or any other legal theory, and whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, our liability is limited to the extent permitted by law. In jurisdictions where such limitations are not allowed, liability is limited to the maximum extent permissible.

### Disclaimer

Your use of the Service is at your sole risk. The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. The Service is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or course of performance.
