OnDrip (the “app”) takes your privacy seriously. It is our policy to respect your privacy regarding any information the app may collect from you. By downloading and using the app, you consent to our privacy policy.

## Personal Information

The app doesn’t collect any personal information and doesn’t share it with third parties. Any data you enter is saved directly in your device and synced via Apple’s iCloud services. We don’t want to access any sensitive data and Apple’s CloudKit technology takes care of it.
